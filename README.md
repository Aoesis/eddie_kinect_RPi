# Eddie_kinect_RPi
Autonomous system that avoids obstacles based on Kinect, RPi and Eddie. Designed to navigate in places like factories or cellars

Stage
You have an environment where you can navigate the Eddie
The kinect sends information constantly from its sensors
Eddie moves in a straight line until the kinect finds a front obstacle at least 2 feet away
When it reaches that distance it will turn to the right and verify if it can continue advancing
It will spin until it finds a clear path to advance.
A stream will be made with a webcam to monitor the Eddie at all times
(sorry for the google translate, im lazzy)
